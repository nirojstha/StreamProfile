#Stream Profile Model

This repository contains MATLAB code for a stream profile model that I used for my thesis. This code is modified version of codes originally developed by Dr. Wolfgang (https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/). The model is designed to simulate the evolution of a stream channel over time, accounting for various physical processes such as erosion, sediment transport, and deposition.

#Getting Started

To use the model, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer. Once you have MATLAB installed, you can download the code from this repository and open the StreamProfiler.mat file in MATLAB. This file contains the main code for running the model.

Before running the model, you will need to change the input. Once you have set the input parameters, you can run the model by executing the file. The output of the model is a plot of the stream channel profile, Ksn values, Chi values, and knickpoints.
